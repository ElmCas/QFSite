        <h1>Dutiez Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 07/01/2024</p>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            At Dutiez, your privacy and data security are our top priorities. We are committed to ensuring that all your interactions within the app remain private and secure. This privacy policy outlines how we handle and protect your data when you use our mobile application, Dutiez.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Data We Collect About You</h2>
        <p>
            Dutiez does not collect, store, or have access to any user data, including personal information, flight data, profile photos, statistics, or any other data displayed within the app. All information remains solely on your device, ensuring your privacy and data security.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Employee ID and Password</h2>
        <p>
            To use the app and its functionality, Dutiez requires you to enter your employee ID and password. However, we do not collect, store, or have access to this information. All credentials are stored locally on your device and are used solely to authenticate your access to the app’s features.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed.
            All data within Dutiez is personal and stored exclusively on your device. We do not transmit, store, or process any data on external servers. This means that your flight details, notes, avoid lists, and any other information you manage through Dutiez are entirely under your control.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>
            To help improve the app and ensure its reliability, Dutiez uses Crashlytics, a crash reporting tool. While Crashlytics collects certain non-personal device information (such as device model, OS version, and crash logs), it does not collect any personally identifiable information. This data is used solely to diagnose and fix issues in the app.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Dutiez does not integrate with any third-party services that would have access to your personal information. We do not share, sell, or otherwise distribute your data to any external entities.

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app, and we encourage you to review this policy periodically.
